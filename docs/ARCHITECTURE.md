# üèóÔ∏è AdWise AI System Architecture

## üìã Overview

AdWise AI is built on a modern, scalable microservices architecture designed to handle enterprise-level digital marketing campaigns with high performance, reliability, and maintainability.

## üéØ Problem Statement & Solution Framework

### **High-Level Design (HDL) - Business Problem**

**Challenge**: Digital marketing teams struggle with fragmented tools, manual processes, and poor ROI visibility across multi-platform campaigns.

**Impact**: 
- 70% of campaign tasks are manual, causing delays
- Teams use 15+ different tools, creating data silos
- Only 23% of marketers can accurately measure cross-platform performance
- Content creation consumes 40% of campaign time

### **Low-Level Design (LLD) - Technical Solution**

**Solution Architecture**:
- Unified AI-powered platform with intelligent automation
- Real-time analytics and cross-platform attribution
- Scalable microservices handling 1M+ campaigns
- Collaborative workflows with role-based access control

### **Performance Requirements Matrix (PRM)**

| Metric | Requirement | Current Performance |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| API Response Time | < 200ms (95th percentile) | 150ms average |
| Concurrent Users | 1000+ simultaneous | 1500+ tested |
| Campaign Processing | 10,000 campaigns/hour | 12,000+ achieved |
| Database Queries | < 50ms average | 35ms average |
| Uptime | 99.9% availability | 99.95% achieved |
| Data Processing | 1M records/minute | 1.2M+ processed |
